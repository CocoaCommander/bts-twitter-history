1. Figure out the api calls (Ryan)
2. Build input for Month + Year (Matthew)
    - Required: Month + Year
    - Optional: Any Keyword
3. Figure out visualization (Brian)
    - Ideas:
        <li>Word Cloud</li>
        <p>Waggle Link for WordCloud:
         https://www.kaggle.com/brianthienho/bts-twitter-api-visuals </p>
       <li> Google Trends-like line graph (only for that month)</li>
       <li> Top 10 tweets sorted by num retweets of a given month</li>

4.   <h1> Post-Presentation Feedback</h1>
     <p>
          During our presentation, we had our website on react and our word cloud on python. We wanted to work together to implement these two code aspects together, but we were unsuccessful. Due to the time crunch, we were unable to find a way to have our python visualization of BTS-related tweets and our BTS website to combine and share data in a meaningful way.

          Within seeing feedback on our presentation, we saw a lot of comments on the use scenario and the ability to engage with content outside of the US. 
    <h2>Use Senario</h2>
         First, when considering the use scenario, our initial motivation was to create a way to see various trends and patterns apparent within Twitter when it comes to BTS. This was just for our interest, but now with seeing the impacts it has, we can also visualize the use it can provide. With Twitter being one of the most used and prevalent social media, especially for ARMY, the use scenario for our project is to help fans find information on BTS, especially for particular keywords, trends, and hashtags. For example, if a fan wants to see the most searched band member, they could use our word cloud in order to view what member had the biggest name. Also, it can help fans and members of Army connect. With seeing fandom pages get recongiton, such as laviedenoona, ARMY members can connect with one another, while also getting updated with BTS information constantly. When fully implemented, our project is designed to have visulizations and tools that egange ARMY and other fans with the most relevent tweets that will provide them with information they may want to know within BTS.
    <h3>Use Senario</h3>
        When considering aspects of other languages and finding top tweets in Japan or South Korea, our data and processing power is limited. With only being able to access certain data due to the API provided, we can only process only that much data. We could only afford to get Twitter API data that came from the US and were in English
